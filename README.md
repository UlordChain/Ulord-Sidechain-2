## Welcome to Ulord-Sidechain-2

## About
Ulord-Sidechain-2 (USC-2) is the improvement of its ancestors USC. The USC-2 provides the same value and functionality to the Ulord ecosystem from its ancestor. In addition, the USC-2 also improves over USC by implementing PBFT like consensus algorithm. Transactions in USC-2 can achieve finality as soon as the block has reached irreversibility i.e. 2/3 + 1 Block Producers produces blocks on top of the block containing this transaction, hence achieving deterministic transaction finality. Moreover, USC-2 implements Drivechain technology for faster 2-way pegging operations, moving funds from one chain to other and vice versa is much faster than ever.


## Getting Started
